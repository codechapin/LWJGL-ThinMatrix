# LWJGL and ThinMatrix
A 3D Game Engine with Java 11 and LWJGL. It follows the 3D Game Engine tutorials by [@ThinMatrix](https://twitter.com/ThinMatrix).

There is a branch for each video in this playlist: [OpenGL 3D Game Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRIWtICgwaX0u7Rf9zkZhLoLuZVfUksDP)

I'm also using the online book [3D Game Development with LWJGL 3](https://ahbejarano.gitbook.io/lwjglgamedev/) as reference.

You will need:
* [JDK 11](https://openjdk.java.net/) OpenJDK or Oracle's OpenJDK are fine.  
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).
* [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), community version is free.

Clone the repository, checkout the respective branch and then in IntelliJ IDEA: File > Open the directory. IDEA will 
recognize that we are using Maven and setup everything for you.

Note that since I'm using a newer version of JDK, LWJGL 3 and Maven, we can use more modern ways to do things and also 
applying my own experience writing Java code.
